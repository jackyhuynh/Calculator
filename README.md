## Introduction
The simple calculator tracker simply develop a window app calculator

## Technology
- C# Programming
- Visual Studio Comunity
- GitHub

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Visual Studio: Visual Studio must be installed for tis particular application. If Visual Studio already install on your computer this will be nice since we can start the program immediately.
- .NET framework must also be installed. Usually .NET is included with Visual Studio, but make sure to check.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

 Visual Studio & Command-Prompt for Visual Studio:

* [Install Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160#:~:text=Visual%20Studio%202019%20Installation%201%20Make%20sure%20your,...%204%20Choose%20workloads.%20...%20More%20items...) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Visual Studio and the Microsoft C# tools yet, here's how to get started. Make sure C# tools is install.
* [Install .NET framework 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - .NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. Please download both the SDK and Runtime if missing.
* There is a video that show you step by step to develop this API (back end only) and test it with Postman [(Click here)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio). Make sure you follow the video to install all the needed component on NuGet Package Manager (Entity frame work for [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)).
